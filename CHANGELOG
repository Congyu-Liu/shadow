A list of user-facing changes since the latest Shadow release.

* We have removed ptrace-mode, and the associated experimental options
`use-o-n-waitpid-workaround` and `--interpose-method`. ptrace-mode was an
alternative to Shadow's current interposition mechanism that uses `LD_PRELOAD`
and `seccomp`. This change should be transparent to most users, since it hasn't
been the default for several releases, and was only accessible via experimental
options. See https://github.com/shadow/shadow/issues/1945

* `dup()` and related syscalls are now supported for all file descriptors
